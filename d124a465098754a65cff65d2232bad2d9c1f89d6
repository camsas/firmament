There\u0027s a possible problem with the approach of filtering jobs: some jobs in the trace are very large, and if you\u0027re simulating a small cluster, they may be larger than the entire cluster resources (and thus never schedule or complete). I believe that\u0027s why Adam filtered the tasks instead.",
