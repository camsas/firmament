      "message": "We want the numerator of the fraction to be slightly larger than the denominator, since otherwise we could either end up with rounding errors (e.g., 0.99 normalized PsPI) or 1.0 as a result, which would lead to the task not scheduling (as the unscheduled aggregator is cheaper or the same price as the best option). I do wonder if this should be ((avg_pspi) * 100 + 1), though -- currently, we\u0027re adding 100, which may be a bit excessive.",
