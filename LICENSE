*** Min-cost, max flow solvers ***

Note that the "cs2" min-cost, max-flow solver is subject to a non-free
license that does not permit commercial use:

If you intend to use Firmament in a commercial production environment, we
recommend that you use our free, BSD-licensed Flowlessly solver instead
(https://github.com/ICGog/Flowlessly).
