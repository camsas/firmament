      "message": "Note for future: we should fix this, since it bakes a relative path into the binary, leading to the simulator failing unless you run it from the simulator directory. This isn\u0027t documented anywhere and has caught each of us out before.\n\nEDIT: this is actually fine, as there is code below to map that relative path to an absolute path. However, we should document that the parameter is relative to the directory of the *binary*, rather than to the Firmament root (or make it relative to the Firmament root).",
