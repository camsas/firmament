      "message": "This takes the scheduler lock from outside the scheduler class, which changes the way that lock is used. Previously, we would only take it from within methods on EventDrivenScheduler. Moreover, the calls on scheduler_ below this line should already be taking the lock.\n\nWhat\u0027s the purpose of taking the lock here? What critical section is being protected?",
