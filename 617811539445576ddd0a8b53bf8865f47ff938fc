Just to check here, how is task_runtime_ itself gets initialized from actual google data? Do we need to modify that part in any way or it was originally implemented?",

In the Google trace loader, it populates the map with the actual runtimes from the trace, so it will work correctly: we pass the map to LoadTaskUtilizationStats, which obtains the runtime for each task and sticks it into the TraceTaskStats structure that is stored in the simulated KB.",
