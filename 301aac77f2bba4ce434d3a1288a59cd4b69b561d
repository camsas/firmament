      "message": "So the logic here is:\n\n  * low CPI, low MAI (lots of compute, but little memory access, i.e. mostly on in-cache data) \u003d\u003e rabbit\n  * high MAI, large page cache (lots of memory access, data-intensive) \u003d\u003e devil\n  * high CPI, high MAI (slow-ish compute, but lots of memory traffic) \u003d\u003e sheep\n  * else \u003d\u003e turtle\n\nCorrect? This seems reasonable, but we should maybe document this rationale in a comment.\n\nMore generally (not for this diff), I wonder if this classification business should be in the cost model, and devil/turtle/rabbit/sheep should just be tags associated with a job/task. That ways, we end up with a more flexible design, but can still do everything we want to do, I think.",
