      "message": "Yes; report gets passed to HandleTaskCompletion, which copies it to the report instance stored in the TD. \n\n1. If we\u0027re handling a local task, msg.report() is empty, so this does no harm, and the details are filled in by the executor (inside the HandleTaskCompletion call). \n\n2. If we\u0027re dealing with a remote task, this line copies the task report included in the completion notification and the executor does not do anything.\n\nThis isn\u0027t totally ideal or the most elegant solution; however, we only have access to the message at this level of abstraction currently, so the copy has to take place here.",
