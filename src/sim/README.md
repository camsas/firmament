Firmament has a simulator that replays cluster traces that respect the format
of the publicly available [Google Trace](https://github.com/google/cluster-data).
With the simulator you either replay the Google trace or traces that you have
created or generated using Firmament.

Binaries are in the src subdirectory of your project build root, and all accept
the `--helpshort` argument to show their command line options.

Before you can run a simulation you need to preprocess the trace in order
to generate task runtime and task usage statistics used by the simulator.
You can do that do that by running:

```console
$ ${BUILD_ROOT}/src/google_trace_processor \
   --trace_path=${PATH_TO_GOOGLE_STYLE_TRACE} \
   --jobs_num_tasks \
   --jobs_runtime \
   --aggregate_task_usage
```

You can run a simulation by executing:

```console
$ ${BUILD_ROOT}/src/simulator
   --simulation=google \
   --trace_path=${PATH_TO_GOOGLE_STYLE_TRACE} \
   --runtime=${MAX_TRACE_TIMESTAMP_TO_SIMULATE} \
   --num_files_to_process=${NUM_EVENT_FILES_IN_THE_TRACE} \
   --scheduler=flow \
   --flow_scheduling_cost_model=${COST_MODEL} \
   --preemption \
   --enable_hdfs_data_locality \
   --simulated_dfs_type=bounded \
   --simulated_block_size=1073741824 \
   --max_sample_queue_size=10 \
   --solver=cs2 \
   --log_solver_stderr \
   --max_solver_runtime=100000000000 \
   --machine_tmpl_file=../../tests/testdata/mach_16pus.pbin \
   --generate_trace \
   --generated_trace_path=${OUTPUT_TRACE_PATH} \
   --generate_quincy_cost_model_trace \
   --log_dir=${PATH_TO_LOG_DIR} \
   --quincy_no_scheduling_delay
```

The simulator will output for analysis a trace that has the same format as the
Google trace. This trace can be used to analyse scheduler runtime or task
placements.

## Replaying synthetic traces
By default, the simulator replays Google-style input traces. If you want to
instead generate and use a synthetic trace, pass the `--simulation=synthetic`
flag, and use the flags from `src/sim/synthetic_trace_loader.cc` or adjust
the class to meet your requirements.

## Extending the simulator with other schedulers
The simulator is not limited to only using Firmament's min-cost flow scheduler.
The `--scheduler=${SCHEDULER_NAME}` flag can be used to control the scheduler to
be used to replay the trace. Currently, we support the min-cost flow scheduler
and a simple queue-based scheduler (i.e. pass `--scheduler=simple`).

If you want to add your own scheduler, you will have to follow the same approach
as used by the `src/scheduling/simple/simple_scheduler.h`. You will have to
implement the abstract methods from `src/scheduling/event_driven_scheduler.h`
and extend `src/sim/simulator_bridge.cc` to instantiate your new scheduler.
